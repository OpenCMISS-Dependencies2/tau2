Installation Procedure: 
-----------------------
In this directory invoke
% ./configure
% make install
This will install the TAU Portable Profiling and Tracing Package.                 
TAU System Requirements :
-------------------------
I) The Profiling Library needs a recent C++ compiler. Recommended :
	a) Kuck and Associates' (http://www.kai.com) KCC compiler
	b) SGI (http://www.sgi.com) MipsPro 7.1 or 7.2 CC compiler

II) Platforms :
   TAU has been tested on 
	a) SGI R10000 based systems.  SGI Power Challenge/ Origin series.
	b) LINUX PCs. Tested with KAI compiler, g++ (-useropt=-fguiding-decls) 
	c) Sun Solaris2. Tested with g++ (./configure -useropt=-fguiding-decls)
	d) HP PA-RISC. Tested with g++. 
	e) Cray T3E. Tested with Cray C++ compiler, and KAI KCC.
	f) DEC Alpha. Tested with g++.
   Other platforms will be supported and it may work with other systems
   with minor modifications.
	

III) Software Requirements :
   a) Tcl/Tk
   TAU's GUI racy needs Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0 or better. The default is 8.0. 
   Tcl/Tk can be downloaded from http://www.sunlabs.com 
   
   b) xauth
   The display needs to be secure. xhost+ should not be used. Xauth style
   security is required. See TAU FAQ on how to use this. Contact your 
   system administrator if your X-server is not configured for Xauth 
   cookies. 

   c) xrdb
   The configure script ensures that the display is ok using xrdb.
  

Configure options :
-------------------
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory). 

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.

   TAU can be configured as follows:

% ./configure -help 
Usage: configure [OPTIONS]
  where [OPTIONS] are:
-prefix=<directory> ............. specifies the installation directory.
-arch=<arch> ....... specifies the target machine arch (sgin32, sgi64). 
-c++=<compiler>  ............................ specify the C++ compiler.
-cc=<compiler> ................................ specify the C compiler.
-useropt='<parameters>' ............... list of commandline parameters.
-pthread .................................. Use pthread thread package.
-tulipthread=<dir> .......... Specify location of Tulip/Smarts package.
-smarts .................. Use SMARTS API for threads (use with above).
-TRACE ..................................... Generate TAU event traces.
-PROFILE ............ Generate profiles (summary statistics) (default).
-PROFILESTATS .................. Enable standard deviation calculation.
-PROFILECOUNTERS .... Use Hardware Performance Counters (default time).
-SGITIMERS .......... Use fast nanosecond timers on SGI R10000 systems.
-help ...................................... display this help message.

   If <prefix> is not specified, configure installs the package in the 
   current directory (TAUROOT). If arch is not specified, it detects it.

   By default if 
   % ./configure 
   is invoked, configure uses time based profiling. This can be overriden
   by -PROFILECOUNTERS option which configures it for using CPU counters.
   -PROFILESTATS is used to configure TAU Profiling Package to generate
   statistics such as standard deviation of exclusive time/counts for 
   each function. This can be viewed using `pprof'.

   -TRACE option generates detailed traces for each node of the parallel 
   application. These traces can be merged and converted to other trace
   formats such as Vampir (www.pallas.de) or SDDF or ALOG or could be viewed
   in the ascii format (dump of the trace). tau_merge and tau_convert tools
   can be used for this. Tracing could be used with or without Profiling. 

   -SGITIMERS uses fast nanosecond resolution timers on R10000 based SGI 
   machines and is recommended for profiling. For tracing this option should
   only be used when compiling in -64 bit mode. 

   -pthread option supports profiling for pthreads based programs. The macro
   TAU_REGISTER_THREAD() should be used in the spawned thread prior to any 
   profiling calls (see examples/threads).

   -tulipthread=<dir> -smarts should be used to specify the smarts directory
   and enable the smarts interface. This is required for Pooma users.

   Example:
   On SGI Origin 2000, 
   % ./configure -c++=KCC 
   or
   % ./configure -c++=CC -useropt='-64 -I/local/apps/STL/'
   or
   % ./configure -TRACE -PROFILE 
   or with g++ 2.8.1+
   % ./configure -useropt=-fguiding-decls
   or 
   % ./configure -c++=KCC -SGITIMERS -tulipthread=/home/smarts/build/smarts-1.0
     -smarts -arch=sgin32 -prefix=/usr/local/packages/tau

2. Compilation.

   Type `make install' to compile the package. 
   Type `make tests' to compile the example programs that are included with
   this distribution.

   Make installs the library and its stub makefile  in <prefix>/<arch>/lib 
   subdirectory and installs utilities such as pprof and racy in 
   <prefix>/<arch>/bin subdirectory.

   
   Add to your .cshrc file the $(TAU_ARCH)/bin subdirectory.
   e.g.,
   # in .cshrc file
   set path=($path /usr/local/packages/tau/sgi64/bin)

3. Examples.

   After building the library, the applications that need to be profiled
   have to be instrumented by manually inserting TAU Profiling calls in the
   source. This is explained in detail in the documentation available at
   http://www.acl.lanl.gov/tau and can be seen in the examples directory.
   This process involves identifying functions and associating each function
   with one or more TAU profile groups. This enables selectively profiling 
   groups of functions. By default all instrumented functions that are 
   invoked are profiled.
   
   % cd examples/instrument
   % ./simple
   % pprof
   % racy

4. Racy.

   Racy is the GUI for TAU performance analysis. It brings up a project
   management window. Type in any filename with a .pmf extension. e.g.,
   matrix.pmf and it will bring up the racy main window.
   
    
5. Modifying user's Makefile for Tracing/Profiling.

   TAU provides a makefile stub file which is placed in the installation
   directory <prefix>/<arch>/lib/Makefile.tau[-optionlist]. Users need to 
   include this makefile and use the make variables TAU_INCLUDE TAU_LIBS
   and TAU_DEFS appropriately in their makefiles. See (examples/instrument
   Makefile)  

6. Support for pthreads
   Pthreads are supported on Cray, SGI and LINUX currently.

7. C API
   C Programs can be profiled using TAU. Instead of TAU_PROFILE() macro
   explicit TAU_PROFILE_TIMER() macros with start/stop interface need to be 
   used. Mixed language programming doesn't seem to work on Cray T3E. Tested
   on Linux, SGI.

8. Using TAU with POOMA
   Set the environment variable TAUDIR to point to the directory where TAU is
   installed. Also, set the variable DUCTAPEDIR to point to the ductape 
   subdirectory in TAU.

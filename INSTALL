Installation Procedure: (ver 2.1)
---------------------------------
In this directory invoke
% ./configure
% make install
This will install the TAU Portable Profiling and Tracing Package.                 
TAU System Requirements :
-------------------------
I) The Profiling Library needs a recent C++ compiler. Recommended :
	a) Kuck and Associates' (http://www.kai.com) KCC compiler
	b) SGI (http://www.sgi.com) MipsPro 7.1 or 7.2 CC compiler
	c) Portland Group Inc. (http://www.pgroup.com) C++ compiler for 
	Intel Teraflop machine at Sandia National Labs/NM.
   It also works with gnu g++ 2.7.2.3 with a reduced functionality and
   should work when gnu supports runtime type information. We are
   in the process of investigating other compilers on different platforms.
	

II) Platforms :
   TAU has been tested on 
	a) SGI R10000 based systems.  SGI Power Challenge/ Origin series.
	Currently support for hardware performance counters is available
   for R10000 based systems and this is the recommended platform for 
   low level hardware profiling for say cache analysis. The default time 
   based profiling is available on a variety of other platforms.
	b) LINUX PCs. Tested with KAI compiler. 
	c) Sun Solaris2. Tested with g++.
	d) HP PA-RISC. Tested with g++. 
	e) Intel Teraflop Machine. Tested with PGI C++ cross compilers.
	f) Cray T3E. Tested with Cray C++ compiler.
   Other platforms will be supported and it may work with other systems
   with minor modifications.
	

III) Software Requirements :
   a) Tcl/Tk
   TAU's GUI racy needs Tcl 7.4/Tk 4.0 or better. The default is 8.0. 
   Tcl/Tk can be downloaded from http://www.sunlabs.com 
   
   b) xauth
   The display needs to be secure. xhost+ should not be used. Xauth style
   security is required. See TAU FAQ on how to use this. Contact your 
   system administrator if your X-server is not configured for Xauth 
   cookies. 

   c) xrdb
   The configure script ensures that the display is ok using xrdb.
  
   d) C++ compiler that supports STL (Standard Templates Library). STL
   can be downloaded from http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/


Configure options :
-------------------
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory). 

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.

   Normally, you just `cd' to the directory containing the package's
source code and type `./configure'. Running `configure' takes a minute or 
two.  While it is running, it prints some messages that tell what it is doing. 
   configure takes the following optional arguments:
   % ./configure -cc=<C Compiler> -c++=<C++ Compiler> 
     -useropt='<list of commandline parameters>'  
     -gnu   
     -sgi
     -ibm
     -dec
     -INTELTFLOP
     -PROFILECOUNTERS
     -PROFILECALLS
     -PROFILESTATS
     -TRACE
     -SGITIMERS

Note: By default if 
   % ./configure 
   is invoked, configure uses time based profiling. This can be overriden
   by -PROFILECOUNTERS option which configures it for using CPU counters.
   -PROFILESTATS is used to configure TAU Profiling Package to generate
   statistics such as standard deviation of exclusive time/counts for 
   each function. This can be viewed using `pprof'.
   -PROFILECALLS is used to generate a trace of exclusive and inclusive 
   counts for each function invocation but there is an additional runtime
   overhead for doing this.

   -TRACE option generates detailed traces for each node of the parallel 
   application. These traces can be merged and converted to other trace
   formats such as Vampir (www.pallas.de) or SDDF or ALOG or could be viewed
   in the ascii format (dump of the trace). tau_merge and tau_convert tools
   can be used for this. Tracing could be used with or without Profiling. 

   SGITIMERS uses fast nanosecond resolution timers on R10000 based SGI 
   machines and is recommended for profiling. For tracing this option should
   only be used when compiling in -64 bit mode. 

   Example:
   On SGI Origin 2000, 
   % ./configure -c++=KCC 
   or
   % ./configure -c++=CC -useropt='-64 -I/local/apps/STL/'
   or
   % ./configure -TRACE -PROFILE 
  Configure changes Makefiles in all subdirectories. It replaces system 
  dependent options and profiling options. The compilation flags associated
  with the above profiling options are :
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter			Compilation Flags
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Default			-DPROFILING_ON
  PROFILECOUNTERS 		-DSGI_HW_COUNTERS
  PROFILESTATS 			-DPROFILE_STATS
  PROFILECALLS			-DPROFILE_CALLS
  SGITIMERS			-DSGI_TIMERS
  TRACE				-DTRACING_ON
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

  These flags are also changed in the examples/ directory. It is 
  *important* for the library and the application to be compiled with 
  the *same* set of compilation flags. After configure, see the Makefile
  in the examples directory for the flags and use it appropriately in 
  other applications. To disable profiling, ensure that -DPROFILING_ON
  is not defined. The instrumented application then runs without any 
  profiling runtime overhead.           

2. Compilation.

   Type `make install' to compile the package.
   Type `make tests' to compile the example programs that are included with
   this distribution.

   Make installs the libraries  in $(TAUROOT)/lib/$(TAU_ARCH) subdirectory
   and installs utilities such as pprof and racy in 
   $(TAU_ROOT)/bin/$(TAU_ARCH) subdirectory.

   
   Add to your .cshrc file the bin/$(TAU_ARCH) subdirectory.
   e.g.,
   # in .cshrc file
   set path=($path /usr/local/packages/tau/bin/sgi8k)

3. Examples.

   After building the library, the applications that need to be profiled
   have to be instrumented by manually inserting TAU Profiling calls in the
   source. This is explained in detail in the documentation available at
   http://www.acl.lanl.gov and can be seen in the examples directory.
   This process involves identifying functions and associating each function
   with one or more TAU profile groups. This enables selectively profiling 
   groups of functions. By default all instrumented functions that are 
   invoked are profiled.
   
   % cd examples/instrument
   % ./simple
   % pprof
   % racy

4. Racy.

   Racy is the GUI for TAU performance analysis. It brings up a project
   management window. Type in any filename with a .pmf extension. e.g.,
   matrix.pmf and it will bring up the racy main window.
   
    
5. Modifying user's Makefile for Tracing/Profiling.

   A sample Makefile is provided in ./include/Makefile and this may be 
   included in other Makefiles for user applications or libraries not 
   in this distribution. It defines the include directories, sets profiling
   and tracing options and provides the libraries that need to be included.
   See the ./include/Makefile for details on how to use this.

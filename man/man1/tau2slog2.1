.SH "NAME"
tau2slog2 \- convert TAU tracefiles to SLOG2 tracefiles
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 10
\fBtau2slog2\fR {\fItau_tracefile\fR} {\fItau_eventfile\fR} {\fB\-o\fR\ \fIslog2_tracefile\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program is generated when TAU is configured with the \-slog2 or \-slog2=<slog2_dir> option.
.PP
The tau2slog2 trace converter takes a single tau trace file (*.trc) and event definition file (*.edf) and produces a corresponding slog2 binary trace file (*.slog2).
.PP
The tau2slog2 converter is called from the command line with the locations of the tau trace and event files. These arguments must be followed by the \-o flag and the name of the slog2 file to be written. tau2slog 2 accepts no other arguments.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
A typical invocation of the converter, to create app.slog2, is as follows:
.sp
.nf
tau2slog2 app.trc tau.edf \-o app.slog2
      
.fi
.sp

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program takes in tau trace files, reorders and corrects the times of these records and then outputs the records to new trace files. The time correction algorithm uses a logical clock algorithm with amortization. This is done by adjusting the times of events such that the product of an effect happens after the cause of that effect.

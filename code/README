Configure TAU with:

./configure -setnode0 -mpi -pthread -useropt="-fPIC -g"

Set your TAU_MAKEFILE to the resulting TAU stub Makefile, add your tau2/x86_64/lib directory to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and then type:

make

-----------

To do this manually:

cd wrapper
make clean ; make
cd ../tau_nexus
make clean ; make

Then you can run examples from the release directory.  To run on mist:

qsub -I -q cuda

Then in the release directory:

./taucuda_profiler.sh ./simpleMultiGPU

Make sure your tau2/x86_64/lib directory is in the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH


NOTES:

set TAU_METRICS=TAUCUDA_TIME adding any other timers will not work.

set TAU_SYNCHRONZIE_CLOCKS=0 otherwise traces will have 0 timestamp.

This example demonstrates TAU's support for OpenACC profiling interface. 
If you are using a PGI compiler that supports the accelerator primitives (license), 
you may try this example as follows:

% make
% tau_exec -T serial,pgi,pdt -openacc ./jacobi
% pprof 

It sets the PGI_ACC_PROFLIB environment variable. For further questions, please contact:

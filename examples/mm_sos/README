This is an example illustrating the integration of SOS with 
MPI via TAU's plugin architecture.


Steps to build and run the example:
1.TAU should be configured using the following options:
./configure -bdf=download -pthread -mpi -sos=$SOS_INSTALL_PATH -pdt=$PDTOOLKIT_PATH
2.SOS_flow should be installed, compatibility with Python in SOS is not needed. 
Install SOS_flow using the following steps:
2a.Instal EVPATH from:
https://www.cc.gatech.edu/systems/projects/EVPath/
2b.Download SOS_flow from:
https://github.com/cdwdirect/sos_flow
3b.Install SOS_flow with:
cmake -DEVPath_DIR=$EVPATH_DIR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SOS_INSTALL_DIR ../sos_flow
3.Compile the matmult application with the provided Makefile using make.
4.In another terminal load the SOS daemon with:
./simple-sos.sh
When the daemon is running, it will show you the Version, the machine it is being 
executed on and other information.
5. Once the daemon is running, execute your application with:
./simple-app.sh
6.Once the application finished, the daemon will close and the database will be 
queried to check code related performance data.

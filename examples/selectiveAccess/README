//Please down load the very latest version of TAU.
//There are a number of changes and additions to this
//API happing on a daily basis (not to mention fixes).
//Comments are VERY welcome.

This API basically allow an application access to TAU's internal
data. You can access the function list, and all data at function name
resolution.  In the example, the beginning and end of the main()
function contains internal data access function examples.

There will be some memory clean up functions, as well as some
addition dump routines added over the next couple of days to complete
the API.  Please check back!!

This example shows how to use the PAPI component plugin to read from all 
available PAPI components (except for perf_event).

Configure PAPI with component support
(i.e. -with-components="rapl nvml lmsensors")

Configure TAU with:
./configure -pthread -bfd=download -mpi -papi=/home/users/khuck/src/papi-5.7.0/install

This example illustrates how the TAU-based selective instrumentation module for LLVM can be used.

## To use this example:

```
source sourceme.sh
make
./program
pprof -a
```

## To compile TAU and the plugin:

### Configuration

```
./configure  -c++=clang++ -cc=clang
```

### Compilation

Once you have configured TAU, compile it:

```
make -j install
```

This will install the plugin in your TAU installation, in the `plugins` directory.

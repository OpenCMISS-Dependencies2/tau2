This example can be used on one or more cores using MPI, pthread, OpenMP or with a hybrid MPI+<thread> runtime. It features a selective instrumentation file that uses outer-loop level instrumentation in two routines. 

It includes calls to the Phiprof interface.

One possible way to configure TAU is with intel compilers:
./configure  -phiprof -ompt -mpi -c++=mpiicpc -cc=mpiicc -fortran=mpiifort -tag=oneapi -bfd=download
make install -j

Add ${arch}/bin to PATH and ${arch}/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and compile the example with:
make

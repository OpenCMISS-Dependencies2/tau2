This example can be used on one or more cores using MPI, pthread, OpenMP or with a hybrid MPI+<thread> runtime. It features a selective instrumentation file that uses outer-loop level instrumentation in two routines. 

It includes calls to the Phiprof interface.

TAU can be configured as follows to use the Phiprof interface:
./configure  -phiprof -bfd=download

Support for specific compilers can be used by passing them to the configuration line, such as, for the Intel compiler suite, wiht a specific tag for this configuration:
./configure  -phiprof -c++=mpiicpc -cc=mpiicc -fortran=mpiifort -tag=oneapi -bfd=download

Other interfaces can also be used with the Phiprof interface:
./configure  -phiprof -ompt -mpi -c++=mpiicpc -cc=mpiicc -fortran=mpiifort -bfd=download

Then TAU can be compiled using make:
make -j install

Add ${arch}/bin to PATH and ${arch}/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and compile the example with:
make

This directory contains example programs that illustrate the use of TAU
instrumentation and measurement options.

instrument 	- This contains a simple C++ example that shows how TAU's
		  API can be used for manually instrumenting a C++ program.

threads		- A simple multi-threaded program that shows how the main
	 	  function of a thread is instrumented. Performance data 
		  is generated for each thread of execution. Uses pthread
 		  library and TAU must be configured with -pthread option.

cthreads	- Same as threads above, but for a C program. An 
		  instrumented C program may be compiled with a C compiler,
		  but needs to be linked with a C++ linker.

sproc		- SGI sproc threads example. TAU should be configured with
		  -sproc option to use this.

pi		- An MPI program that calculates the value of pi and e. It
		  highlights the use of TAU's MPI wrapper library. TAU needs
		  to be configured with -mpiinc=<dir> and -mpilib=<dir> to 
		  use this.

mpishlib        - Demonstrates the use of MPI wrapper library in instrumenting
                  a shared object. The MPI application is instrumented is 
                  instrumented as well. TAU needs to be configured with 
                  -mpiinc=<dir> and -mpilib=<dir> flags. 

python          - Instrumentation of a python application can be done 
                  automatically or manually using the TAU Python bindings. Two 
                  examples, auto.py and manual.py demonstrate this respectively.
                  TAU needs to be configured with 
                  -pythoninc=<dir that contains Python.h> 
                  option and the user needs to set PYTHONPATH to 
                  <taudir>/<arch>/lib to use this feature. 

traceinput      - To build a trace converter/trace reader application, we 
                  provide the TAU trace input library. This directory contains
                  two examples (in c and c++ subdirectories) that illustrate 
                  how an application can use the trace input API to read online
                  or post-mortem TAU binary traces. It shows how the user can 
                  register routines with the callback interface and how TAU 
                  invokes these routines when events take place. 

papi		- A matrix multiply example that shows how to use TAU statement
		  level timers for comparing the performance of two algorithms 
		  for matrix multiplication. When used with PAPI or PCL, this
		  can highlight the cache behaviors of these algorithms. TAU 
		  should be configured with -papi=<dir> or -pcl=<dir> and the 
		  user should set PAPI_EVENT or PCL_EVENT respective environment
		  variables, to use this.

papithreads	- Same as papi, but uses threads to highlight how hardware 
		  performance counters may be used in a multi-threaded 
		  application. When it is used with PAPI, TAU should be 
		  configured with -papi=<dir> -pthread

autoinstrument  - Shows the use of Program Database Toolkit (PDT) for 
		  automating the insertion of TAU macros in the source code. It
		  requires configuring TAU with the -pdt=<dir> option. The 
		  Makefile is modified to illustrate the use of a source to 
		  source translator (tau_instrumentor). 

reduce          - Shows the use of tau_reduce, a utility that can read profiles                   and a set of rules and determine which routines should not 
                  be instrumented (for frequently called light-weight routines).                  See <tau>/utils/TAU_REDUCE.README file for further details. 
                  It requires configuring TAU with -pdt=<dir> option.

cinstrument     - Shows the use of PDT for C. Requires configuring TAU with 
                  -pdt=<dir> option.

mixedmode	- This example illustrates the use of PDT, hand-instrumentation
		  (for threads), MPI library instrumentation and TAU system 
		  call wrapper library instrumentation. Requires configuring TAU
		  with -mpiinc=<dir> -mpilib=<dir> -pdt=<dir> -pthread options.

pdt_mpi         - This directory contains C, C++ and F90 examples that 
		  illustrate how TAU/PDT can be used with MPI. Requires 
                  configuring TAU with -pdt=<dir> -mpiinc=<dir> -mpilib=<dir> 
                  options. You may also try this with the -TRACE -epilog=<dir> 
                  options to use the EPILOG tracing package (from FZJ). 

selective	- This example illustrates the use of PDT, and selective 
		  profiling using profile groups in the tau_instrumentor. 
		  Requires configuring TAU with -pdt=<dir> -fortran=<...> 
		  options.

fortran & f90   - Show how to instrument a simple Fortran 90 program. A C++ 
		  linker needs to be used when linking the fortran application.

NPB2.3		- The NAS Parallel Benchmark 2.3 [from NASA Ames]. It shows how
		  to use TAU's MPI wrapper with a manually instrumented Fortran
		  program. LU and SP are the two benchmarks. LU is instrumented
	 	  completely, while only parts of the SP program are 
		  instrumented to contrast the coverage of routines. In both 
		  cases MPI level instrumentation is complete. TAU needs to be
		  configured with -mpiinc=<dir> and -mpilib=<dir> to use this.

dyninst		- An example that shows the use of DyninstAPI [U. Maryland, 
		  U. Wisconsin] to insert TAU instrumentation. Using Dyninst, 
		  no modifications are needed and tau_run, a runtime 
		  instrumentor, inserts TAU calls at routine transitions in 
		  the program. [This represents work in progress]. 

dyninstthreads  - The above example with threads.

java/pi		- Shows a java program for calculating the value of pi. It 
		  illustrates the use of the TAU JVMPI layer for instrumenting
		  a Java program without any modifications to its source code,
		  byte-code or the JVM. It requires a Java 2 compliant JVM and
		  TAU needs to be configured with the -jdk=<dir> option to use
		  this. 

java/api	- The same Pi program as above that illustrates the use of the 
                  TAU Java API for source level instrumentation. See the README
                  file in that directory for details on how to compile and run
                  the application.

openmp		- Shows how to manually instrument an OpenMP program using the 
		  TAU API. There are subdirectories for C, C++ and F90 to show
		  the differences in instrumentation and Makefiles. TAU needs to
		  be configured with the -openmp option to use this. 

opari		- Opari is an OpenMP directive rewriting tool that works with 
		  TAU. Configure TAU with -opari=<dir> option to use this. This
		  provides detailed instrumentation of OpenMP constructs. There 
		  are subdirectories for C++, pdt_f90, and OpenMPI to 
                  demonstrate the use of this tool. The pdt_f90 directory 
		  contains an example that shows the use of PDT with Opari for
 		  a Fortran 90 program. 

openmpi		- Illustrates TAU's support for hybrid exection models in the 
		  form of MPI for message passing and OpenMP threads. TAU needs
		  to be configured with -mpiinc=<dir> -mpilib=<dir> -openmp
		  options to use this. 

fork		- Illustrates how to register a forked process with TAU. TAU
		  provides two options: TAU_INCLUDE_PARENT_DATA  and 
		  TAU_EXCLUDE_PARENT_DATA which allows the child process to 
		  inherit or clear the performance data when the fork takes 
		  place. 


mapping		- Illustrates two examples in the embedded and external 
                  subdirecto ries. These correspond to profiling at the object 
                  level, where the time spent in a method is displayed for a 
                  specific object. There are two ways to achieve this using an 
                  embedded association, that requires an extension of the class 
                  definition with a TAU pointer and a second scheme of external                   hash-table lookup that relies on looking at the object 
                  address at each method invocation. Both these examples 
                  illustrate the use of the TAU Mapping API.

multicounters   - Illustrates the use of multiple measurement options configured
                  simultaneously in TAU. See README file for instructions on 
                  setting the env. variables COUNTERS<1-25> for specifying 
                  measurements. Requires configuring TAU with -MULTIPLECOUNTERS.

selectiveAccess - Illustrates the use of TAU API for runtime access of TAU
	  	  performance data. A program can get information about routines
		  executing in its context. This can be used in conjunction with
		  multiple counters.

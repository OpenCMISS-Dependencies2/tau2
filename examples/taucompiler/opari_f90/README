The current version of TAU's $(TAU_COMPILER) does not support invocation of
opari. Opari needs to be explicitly invoked for each file. However, we 
illustrate how this can be done in this example. Future versions of this tool 
will feature support for automatically invoking opari from within the tool. 
See the Makefile for details.

This tool converts OTF2 traces to TAU profile format. 
To configure, please edit the Makefile and put in the location of the OTFDIR. Or
% make clean
% make OTFDIR=/usr/local/packages/otf2-1.1.1

We have included a simple dataset in the data subdirectory for testing:
% cd data

% otf2profile traces.otf2
% pprof
% paraprof

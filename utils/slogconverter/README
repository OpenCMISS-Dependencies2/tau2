tau2slog2 takes a single string argument: the location of the tau .trc file and the tau .edf 
file separated by a colon.  Note:  On systems that require .a rather than .so for shared 
libraries the library generated by the makefile may have to be renamed.

slogtest generates the trace_impl.h header file.  It requires 2 arguments; the Java home 
directory and the name of the Java archetecture directory (if one is present).

tau2slog2.skel generates the script that executes tau2slog2.  It requires 3 arguments; the Java 
home directory, the tau home directory and the slog2sdk home directory.

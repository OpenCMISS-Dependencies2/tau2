The configurations using impi need a running mpd. cron starts this
daemon at reboot, see crontab.

Initially we need to create bitten ini files. This is done by
create_bitten_ini_files.sh for various compiler/mpi combinations.

As the bitten-slaves crash from time to time we need to ensure that
they get restarted. Therefore cron executes the scripts
start_bitten_slaves_(32|64)bit.sh and
start_bitten_slaves_(32|64)bit_mpi.sh every hour. They check if
bitten-slaves of various compiler/mpi combinations are already
running. If not, they get (re-)started.

There is one bitten-slave per compiler/mpi combination. Before the
slave is started, the necessary modules are loaded. For debugging
purposes the environment is dumped to ${BITTEN_DIR}/environment/.

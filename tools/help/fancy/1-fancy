            @{blue {FANCY}} (File ANd Class displaY)

lets you browse through the files and classes used in the
source text of the current user application, and lets you
view the source text of its functions or methods.

The @{blue {fancy main window}} displays four listboxes. The two
left ones show all sources files used (@{ul {Files}}) and all
classes defined (@{ul {Classes}}) for the current application.
Selecting one item in either of these listboxes with the
left mouse button displays all global functions defined
for the selected file (in @{ul {Functions}}) or all member
functions of the selected class (in @{ul {Methods}}) respectively.

Selecting a function or method will invoke the
@{L {global feature} {showHelp general 2-gfeatures}} "selectFunction" on it. In the fancy
tool "selectFunction" will use the @{L {viewer} {showHelp fancy 1.1-viewer}} to display the
source text of the selected function or method.

To exit the fancy tool use the @{button { Exit }} entry in the
@{button { File }} menu or press the key "Q".

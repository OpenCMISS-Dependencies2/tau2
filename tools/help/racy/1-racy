      @{blue {RACY}} (Routine and data ACcess profile displaY)

is the TAU @{blue {parallel profile data viewer}}. After compiling
an application for profiling and running it, racy lets
you browse through the function and collection profile
data generated. It is a graphical frontend to @{blue {pprof}}.

A summary of the @{L {function profile data} {showHelp racy 1.2-funcsum}} is displayed in
the left bargraph. The @{L {collection access data profile} {showHelp racy 1.3-collsum}}
summary is shown on the right side. Through clicking on
objects in the bargraphs, more detailed information about
the object can be displayed. This is described in detail
in the help screens of the single bargraph windows.

The racy master window @{L {menubar} {showHelp racy 1.1-menu}} lets you print the
summary bargraphs or setup default configurations for
bargraph displays.

To exit the racy tool use the @{button { Exit }} entry in the
@{button { File }} menu or press the key "Q".

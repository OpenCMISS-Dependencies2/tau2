        @{blue {MIGHTY}} (Make and error highlIGHTing displaY)

provides a user-friendly and convenient way of compiling
and executing programs with the help of Makefiles. It can
be used as a @{L {cosy} {showHelp cosy 1-cosy}} replacement for non-pC++ programs. The
@{button { File }} menu allows the user to activate the necessary
commands to @{L {compile and execute} {showHelp mighty 1.1-file}} programs. By using the
@{button { Options }} menu, the user can @{L {set parameters and options} {showHelp mighty 1.2-options}}
for making and running programs. The row of command
buttons provide @{L {shortcuts} {showHelp mighty 1.3-buttons}} to frequently used commands.

Mighty automatically searches for files named @{blue {[Mm]akefile*}}
and scans them for target and macro definitions. If more
than one file is found, the user is prompted for one file
to choose. Mighty executes user-specified commands, and
displays the results or error messages in a scrollable
window. The currently executed (compilation or execution)
command, is shown on top of the display area behind the
@{button { executing: }} label. It is the same command, the user would
have to type when not using mighty.

To exit the mighty tool use the @{button { Exit }} entry in the @{button { File }}
menu or press the key "Q".

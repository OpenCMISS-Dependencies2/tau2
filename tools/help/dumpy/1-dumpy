            @{blue {DUMPY}} (DUMPdep output displaY)

lets you browse through the statement (BIF nodes) graph,
expression trees, and type graphs of the program tree
stored in a depfile. It is a graphical interface to the
@{blue {dumpdep}} utility. The information is presented in
several windows:

[1] @{L {main (BIF nodes/statement) graph} {showHelp dumpy 1.1-main}} window

[2] @{L {expression tree} {showHelp dumpy 1.2-expr}} window  [4] @{L {dumpdep output text} {showHelp dumpy 1.4-dump}} window 

[3] @{L {type graph} {showHelp dumpy 1.3-type}} window       [5] @{L {source code} {showHelp dumpy 1.5-text}} window

In the beginning, dumpy displays only the main window. The
other windows are shown or updated by mouse clicks on items
which represent program tree nodes. The @{L {mouse bindings} {showHelp dumpy 1.6-bind}} are
almost the same in every window. There are also @{L {commands} {showHelp dumpy 1.7-com}}
available through menus or keyboard shortcuts.

To exit the dumpy tool use the @{button { Quit }} entry in the
@{button { File }} menu or press the @{mbut { Q }} key.

          @{blue {TAU}} (Tuning and Analysis Utilities)

is a set of @{ul {hypertools}}, which are part of the pC++
programming and analysis environment. We call them
hypertools because while they are distinct tools, they
act in concert like they were one big application. Each
tool implements one well defined task. If one tool needs
a feature of another one, it sends a message to the other
tool requesting the necessary function. For an example
see the @{L {selectFunction} {showHelp general 2-gfeatures}} feature.

This window represents the @{blue {master control panel}}, which
provides some basic functionality for all TAU tools.
This functionality can be invoked through selecting
it in the @{L {menubar} {showHelp tau 1.1-menu}}. Some basic information about the
current user application is shown in the @{L {display area} {showHelp tau 1.2-display}}.
The individual TAU tools can be invoked through the
@{L {command buttons} {showHelp tau 1.3-buttons}}.

If you need more information on how to use this
online help system, click @{L {here} {showHelp general 1-help}}.

    @{blue {COSY}} (COmpile and execution manager Status displaY)

provides a user-friendly and convenient way of compiling
and executing programs.

1) The @{L {Project} {showHelp cosy 1.1-project}} menu (on standalone cosy) enables the user
   to select a project or change project options.

2) The @{L {File} {showHelp cosy 1.2-file}} menu allows the user to add or delete files to
   the project.

3) The @{L {View} {showHelp cosy 1.3-view}} menu lets the user affect command output.

4) The @{L {Make} {showHelp cosy 1.4-make}} menu activates the necessary commands to
   compile programs.

5) The @{L {Run} {showHelp cosy 1.5-run}} menu activates the necessary commands to execute
   programs.

6) The @{L {Options} {showHelp cosy 1.6-options}} menu lets the user specify command
   parameters.

7) The @{L {Errors} {showHelp cosy 1.7-errors}} menu (on non-standalone cosy) lets the user
   scroll through errors.

The user can choose to compile and execute the current
application in @{button {<> normal}}, @{button {<> profiling}}, @{button {<> tracing}}, or
@{button {<> breakpointing}} mode. The row of command buttons provide
@{L {shortcuts} {showHelp cosy 1.8-buttons}} to frequently used commands from various menus.

Cosy automatically connects, if necessary, to the remote
machine, executes the appropriate commands, and displays
the results or error messages in a scrollable window. The
currently executed (compilation or execution) command is
shown on top of the display area behind the @{button { executing: }}
label. It is the same command the user would have to type
when not using cosy.

To exit the cosy tool, use the @{button { Exit }} entry in the
@{L {Project} {showHelp cosy 1.1-project}} menu (if standalone) or @{L {File} {showHelp cosy 1.2-file}} menu (if not),
or press the "Q" key.

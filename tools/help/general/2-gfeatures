@T the TAU tool global features

@D ul {-underline true}
@D blue {-foreground blue}

Currently, the TAU tools support two @{blue {global features}},
which operate on function objects (i.e. procedures,
functions, routines or methods of the underlying source
code). They can be invoked by clicking on items of the TAU
tools graphical interface which represent function objects
(e.g. a node in the call graph or a function name label).

1) @{ul {showFunction:}} Normally invoked by the middle mouse
      button. Displays a small table showing basic
      information available about that function.

2) @{ul {selectFunction:}} Normally invoked by the right mouse
      button. It will "select" that function @{blue {in each tool}}
      @{blue {window currently displayed}}. The meaning of "select"
      is tool-dependent (e.g. highlight the source code of
      the function in the viewer window of the fancy
      tool). See the help screens of the individual tools
      for more information.

There are plans of having more global features like this
in future releases of the TAU tools (e.g. support the
same functionality for class or collection objects).

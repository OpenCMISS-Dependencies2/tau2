Welcome to the @{blue {TAU online help}} system!

There is not much to say about how to use the TAU online
help system. Each time you invoke one of the help commands
from the tool's menubar, this help window pops up, or if
it already exists, the text is updated.
 
In the lower right corner of the window, you see the
@{button { close }} button. Clicking on it with the left mouse button
will close the help window.
 
Sometimes, there is more detailed information about a
specific topic available. This information can be accessed
by clicking on a "link". A link looks like this:

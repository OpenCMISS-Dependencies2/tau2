This directory has (or will have) the files generated by the javadoc command.  

Before running javadoc, make sure that perfdb has been made, and perfdb.jar
is available.

To make the DMS javadoc files, run "make javadoc" in the parent directory 
($TAUROOT/tools/src/dms).  Then open the file dms/doc/index.html in a web 
browser.

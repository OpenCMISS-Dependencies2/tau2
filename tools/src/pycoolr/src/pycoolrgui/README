PyCOOLR is a GUI able to plot generic events coming from tools. These events can be filtered to be plotted via metrics the user has to select.
PyCOOLR supports tools such as BEACON (Backplane for Event Control and Notification) and SOS (Scalable Observation System).

Usage:

./pycoolr -tool=<beacon|sos> -platform=<cerberus.nic.uregon.edu|...>

Once the GUI is started, the user can:
- Select the menu "Preferences"
- Select the sub menu "Metrics"

The user also can modify the font size of the GUI:
- Select the menu "Preferences"
= Select the sub menu "Fonts"

A window opens where the user can change the font policy and the size.

Then the user can see the selected events to be plotted. 

PyCOOLR reads configuration file where it picks the necessary information such as metrics.

BEACON:


SOS: 
PyCOOLR reads a database file generated by SOS, reads the events from the file and makes them available to be plotted

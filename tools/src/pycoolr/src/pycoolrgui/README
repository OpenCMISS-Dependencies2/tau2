PyCOOLR is a GUI able to plot generic events coming from tools. These events can be filtered to be plotted via metrics the user has to select.
PyCOOLR supports tools such as BEACON (Backplane for Event Control and Notification) and SOS (Scalable Observation System).

Usage:

./pycoolr -tool=<beacon|sos> -platform=<cerberus.nic.uregon.edu|...>

Once the GUI is started, the user can:
- Select the menu "Preferences"
- Select the sub menu "Metrics"

Then the user can see the selected events to be plotted.

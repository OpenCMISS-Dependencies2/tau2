PyCOOLR is a GUI able to plot generic events coming from tools. These events can be filtered to be plotted via metrics the user has to select.
PyCOOLR supports tools such as BEACON (Backplane for Event Control and Notification) and SOS (Scalable Observation System).

Usage:

./pycoolr -tool=<beacon|sos> -platform=<cerberus.nic.uregon.edu|...>

Once the GUI is started, the user can:
- Select the menu "Preferences"
- Select the sub menu "Metrics"
- A window labelled "metrics" shows up, then the user can select some metrics from a given list

The user also can modify the font size of the GUI:
- Select the menu "Preferences"
- Select the sub menu "Fonts"

A window opens where the user can change the font policy and the size.

Then the user can see the selected events to be plotted. 

PyCOOLR reads configuration file where it picks some necessary information such as metrics.

Some other features are specific to each tool PyCOOLR is connected to.

BEACON:
- One interesting use case coming with BEACON is to couple runtime introspection and monitoring of MPI libraries, using the MPI Tools Interface (MPI-T). 
MPI-T allows exhibition of MPI internals to the user through Performance Variables PVARs. When coupled to TAU Performance Tools, BEACON proposes a set of PVARs as metrics the user can select, to be monitored. 
It can be done by selection the "Metrics" submenu. 
Also, the user can easily update a list of Control Variables (CVARs) to tune the MPI runtime: In the "Settings" menu, the user can select "CVARS" submenu. A window shows up, and the user can select some CVARs on a given list. 
He then can just update associated values and update them to the MPI library, via the TAU Performance tool.  

SOS: 
PyCOOLR reads a database file generated by SOS, reads the events from the file and makes them available to be plotted

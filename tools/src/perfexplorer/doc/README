The RSJava omegahat version installed is from:
http://simon.urbanek.info/simon/yawe/research/other.html

Build instructions for R on OS X:
http://cran.us.r-project.org/
(make sure to use the 'shared' options for configure.)
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua --enable-shared --enable-R-shlib

After installing, in the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.1/Resources/library/SJava/libs directory, make .dylib and .jnilib links to the .so file.

todo:
we should have non-modal dialogs, so comparisons can be made.

need to replace all the intermingled Java & R code with an R function, and call it.

memory - see ?Memory and ?clara in R (library(cluster))
might not be able to do hclust on large data...

Notes from board:

bioconductor.org

App Functionality:
------------------
* Select Trial
* Select Metric (or not)
* Do Hierarchical Clustering
* Suggest Cluster #, centers > or use Bradley98 paper
  Select Cluster Method (KM, KHM, GEM, FKM, H1, H2) - or implement own! 
   - make it programmable and flexible
* Select Dimension Reduction
* Select Normalization
* Graph Results to PNG
* Save results to DBMS
* Show Thumbnails
  Do Factor Analysis on Clusters
  Do Linear Regression Analysis

For Charting:
-------------
Dimensions:
	Experiment (machine, options, etc.)
	Trial (nodes, contexts, threads, etc.)
	Metric Name
	Group Name
	Event Name

TODO LIST:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data should be self-describing!
How to save the process - the workflow?  Scripting approach?
DONE - Need to add phase data, too!
DONE - how to do "ideal" line?
Analysis management, not experiment management.  How to make sense of the data you have collected?  What're the significant factors?

Fix the hierarchical clustering
DONE - Add PCA - should be easy.
Add T^2 (Hotelling) test
Add t-test
	Use weka.experiment.PairedTTester
PCA and Factor Analysis do dimension reduction...
	DONE - Use weka.attributeSelection.PrincipalComponents
	Need to make this an option for dimension reduction (replace
	linear regression)
Use weka.classifiers.functions.SimpleLinearRegression and LinearRegression?
Use weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.RandomProjection?
Factor Analysis?
F-Ratio?
	weka.core.Statistics.FProbabilty()
ChiSquared Test?
	weka.attributeSelection.ChiSquaredAttributeEval

DONE - Need to add virtual topology for Weka output.
Need to add min/max to weka output.
Need to fix hierarchical clustering for Weka.
Need to make R/Weka interchangable.
Need to replace the Weka PCA clusters with something "else"...

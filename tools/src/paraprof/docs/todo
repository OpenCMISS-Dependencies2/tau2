Currently group information is stored in GlobalMappingElement.  This could cause
issues if the user changes assigns different groups on a thread level to the
same mapping. Ie, we do not show thread-level granularity for groups.

When ParaProf reads raw data output from tau, if it encounters duplicate names then
treat it as additional data, and add to the name data rather then overwrite as is
currently the case.  The most likely source of this is runtime template typing
issues with certain c++ compilers.  This functionality will then mirror pprof.

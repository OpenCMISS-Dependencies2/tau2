Currently group information is stored in GlobalMappingElement.  This could cause
issues if the user changes assigns different groups on a thread level to the
same mapping. Ie, we do not show thread-level granularity for groups.

When ParaProf reads raw data output from tau, if it encounters duplicate names then
treat it as additional data, and add to the name data rather then overwrite as is
currently the case.  The most likely source of this is runtime template typing
issues with certain c++ compilers.  This functionality will then mirror pprof.

So /tmp/bin/paraprof should work.

Add second mouse button support for users with only one mouse button (apple).

# Report 16
# Date: 4th August 2004
# Status: (outstanding)
# Reporter: Sameer Shende (University of Oregon).
The user sees three buttons open, select and cancel (when loading a trial). By navigating to the
correct directory, one needs to click on select and then it works. It just 
felt clunky. I thought double clicking on the name of a directory and
navigating to it and clicking "OK/Select" (with a second Cancel button) might be easier.

We do not support max stats. in the thread objects for anything other than
mapping selection 1.  We probalby should, or re-think whether to just
re-generate that information on the fly.

Is there a way to turn the "show values as percentage"
option to off (unchecked) for derived counters (PAPI_FP_INS/TIME) as it
doesn't make sense to show it as a percentage and I check it off each time
I look at it.

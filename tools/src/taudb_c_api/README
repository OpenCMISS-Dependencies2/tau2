Notes:

- this library is only just beginning to take shape.
- this library will only support the 2005 schema at first.
- as 2012 schema support is added, you can expect more robust behavior.
- only PostgreSQL is supported.
- You will need to set the path to the PostgreSQL header and library
  in Makefile.inc.

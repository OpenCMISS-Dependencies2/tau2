REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL INTERACTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL TAU TOOLS
	(very Alpha version!)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initialization:
---------------

  Note: All tools (except tau and taud) may be called with the 
  command-line parameter, "-name <interpname>", which specifies what to
  name the interpreter.  It should come before all other parameters and
  will be removed from the argc and argv variables before the main body
  of the tool is sourced.

  1. Source "bdbm_utils.tcl", "pm_utils.tcl", and "depfile.tcl"
  2. Check if taud is running and launch it if not (launchTauDaemon).
  3. Define procedures for the tool.
  4. Define the tool-specific function, PM_AcceptChanges, to update the
     tool in response to project changes.
  5. Call PM_AddTool
  6. Call PM_AddGlobalSelect for any global select functions the tool should 
     receive.
  7. Parse tool's command-line args and call PM_OpenProject appropriately.
  8. Call PM_Status to get host, arch, dir, and root info :
	MUST SET depfile(...) with these values.

  9. Call functions to initialize the browser, such as:
	PM_GetFiles, PM_GetHeaders:
		To get lists of files available for browsing
	Bdb_GetClasses: 
		To get a list of classes
	Bdb_GetMainTag: 
		To get the tag for the project's main
	CgmLoadAllDeps:
		To load in all depfiles (probably not practical)
 10. Lanch TAU main window


Exiting:
--------
  1. Call PM_RemTool


Browsing:
---------
  -  To obtain browsing info for a function (class):

	Call Bdb_QueryFunc (Bdb_QueryClass) to determine which
	depfile to load (if necessary), tag, and line number for each
	match.  If full depfile info is needed check that the depfile 
	is loaded using Cgm_IsDepLoaded.  If the depfile is not loaded,
	load it with Cgm_LoadDep.  Call one of the accessors to get 
	the needed depfile info: Cgm_FuncInfo, Cgm_ClassInfo, Cgm_MemInfo,
	or Cgm_DepInfo.

  - To invoke global select function
	
	Call PM_GlobalSelect to broadcast the select.
